# Zyte Framework

Ultra-light PHP web framework originaly built back in 2016-2017 whenever I was learning more about APIs and the usage of JWT as part of my earlier job. Was intending to continue working on it as a alternative to Slim framework for PHP, but the project was quit after I started working with Python and Django.
