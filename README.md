# Zyte Framework

Ultra-light PHP web framework originaly built back in 2016-2017 as a training project for learning more about constructing secure APIs and learning more about the use JWT. Was intending to continue working on as an open source project and have it as an alternative to Slim framework for PHP, but the project was quit after I started working with Python and Django.

Feel free to take this as a skeleton for your own framework. Although I would love to hear what it is being used for, but no obligations attached.
